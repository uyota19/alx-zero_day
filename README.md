My first readme
This project was designed to learn about Git
The directory '0x03-git' is a parent directory to two directories (bash an c)
In the 'bash' directory, two non empty files called 'alx' and 'school' were created.
In the 'c' directory an empty file was created.
Finally, a branch called 'update_script' exist with some modified files from the master branch and they haven't been merged.
